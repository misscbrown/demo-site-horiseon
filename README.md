Horiseon is a digital marketing agency that needed some updated code for their website. I have not changed the layout or how anything works, I tidied up the code in html and made sure the links were working correctly. The SEO link was not working so I fixed that. I commented the code in the CSS file and made the HTML easier to read by adding descriptions. I have added alt attributes to all images, which helps to improve the sites SEO as well as making it accessible to people with disabilities. The page loads with no errors.
